Summarize the chunk for retrieval.

Output two sections only.

First section:
This chunk is about:
- <Category>: <names or topics>
- <Category>: <names or topics>

First-section rules:
1. List entity/topic categories. Do not list facts here.
2. Use only clear, useful categories.
3. Good categories include People, Companies, Organizations, Places, Roles, Projects, Products, Systems, Concepts, Events, and Topics.
4. Keep category lines short.

Second section:
Facts:
- <self-contained fact>
- <self-contained fact>

Second-section rules:
1. Write complete sentences with clear subjects from the first section.
2. Each fact must stand alone without the chunk or the other facts.
3. Order facts by: time first, category second, entity/topic third.
4. Do not group all facts about one entity if that makes the facts jump backward or forward in time.
5. Make sure the facts cover the full content of the chunk.
6. Do not invent.

Max 200 tokens.
