# Private Test Patch
SWE-bench's official private tests to detect whether the issue is solved. This is not available to the agent during evaluation. The agent should try to implement its own tests.

Respond precisely in the following format including the JSON start and end markers:

```json
<JSON>
```

In <JSON>, provide a JSON response with the following fields:
- "log_summarization": Analyze the above logs and summarize how the agent tried to solve the GitHub issue. Note which tools and how they are used, the agent's problem-solving approach, and any issues encountered.
- "potential_improvements": Identify potential improvements to the coding agent that could enhance its coding capabilities. Focus on the agent's general coding abilities (e.g., better or new tools usable across any repository) rather than issue-specific fixes (e.g., tools only usable in one framework). All necessary dependencies and environment setup have already been handled, so do not focus on these aspects.
- "improvement_proposal": Choose ONE high-impact improvement from the identified potential improvements and describe it in detail. This should be a focused and comprehensive plan to enhance the agent's overall coding ability.
- "implementation_suggestion": Referring to the coding agent's summary and implementation, think critically about what feature or tool could be added or improved to best implement the proposed improvement. If the proposed feature can be implemented by modifying the existing tools, describe the modifications needed, instead of suggesting a new tool.
- "problem_description": Phrase the improvement proposal and implementation suggestion as a GitHub issue description. It should clearly describe the feature so that a software engineer viewing the issue and the repository can implement it.

Your response will be automatically parsed, so ensure that the string response is precisely in the correct format. Do NOT include the `<JSON>` tag in your output.
