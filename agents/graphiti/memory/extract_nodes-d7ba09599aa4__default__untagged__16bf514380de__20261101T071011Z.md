NEVER extract:
- Pronouns (you, me, he, she, they, it, them, him, her, we, us, this, that, those)
- Abstract concepts (joy, balance, growth, resilience, passion, motivation)
- Generic common nouns or bare object words (day, life, people, work, stuff, things, food, time,
  tickets, supplies, clothes, keys, gear)
- Generic media/content nouns unless uniquely identified in the node name itself (photo, pic, picture,
  image, video, post, story)
- Generic event/activity nouns unless uniquely identified in the node name itself (event, game, meeting,
  class, workshop, competition)
- Broad institutional nouns unless explicitly named or uniquely qualified (government, school, company,
  team, office)
- Ambiguous bare nouns whose meaning depends on sentence context rather than the node name itself
- Sentence fragments or clauses as entity names
- Bare relational or kinship terms (dad, mom, sister, brother, spouse, friend, boss, pet, dog,
  cat) unless qualified with a possessor (e.g., "Nisha's dad" is acceptable, "dad" alone is not)
- Bare generic objects that cannot be meaningfully qualified with a possessor, brand, or
  distinguishing detail (e.g., NEVER extract "supplies" from "I picked up some supplies")

Extract entities from the TEXT that are **explicitly mentioned**.
For each entity, classify it using the ENTITY TYPES above.
Only extract entities specific enough to be uniquely identifiable — ask: "Could this have its own Wikipedia article or database entry?"

<ENTITY TYPES>
{context['entity_types']}
</ENTITY TYPES>

<TEXT>
{context['episode_content']}
</TEXT>

Guidelines:
1. Extract named entities and specific, concrete things.
2. Do not create nodes for relationships or actions.
3. Do not create nodes for temporal information like dates, times or years.
4. Be explicit in node names, using full names and avoiding abbreviations.
5. Always use the most specific form from the text (e.g., "road cycling" not "cycling",
   "wool coat" not "coat"). Include qualifying context when it's clear from the text.
6. When the text refers to a person's relative, pet, or associate by a bare term, qualify the
   entity with the possessor's name (e.g., "Dr. Osei's colleague" not "colleague").
7. If a phrase would not be meaningful and distinguishable when read alone later, do NOT extract it.
8. When in doubt, do NOT extract.

{context['custom_extraction_instructions']}

<EXAMPLE>
Text: "Dr. Amara Osei presented her migraine study results at the AAN conference. The study tracked 340 patients using a new CGRP combination protocol."
Good extractions: "Dr. Amara Osei" (Person), "AAN" (Organization), "migraine study" (Topic), "CGRP combination protocol" (Object)
Do NOT extract: "results" (generic noun), "340" (number), "patients" (generic noun), "conference" (generic without a specific name)
</EXAMPLE>

<EXAMPLE>
Text: "Alex shared a pic after the event and said scoring the last basket felt incredible."
Good extractions: "Alex" (Person)
Do NOT extract: "pic" (generic media noun), "event" (generic event noun), "basket" (ambiguous bare noun)
</EXAMPLE>
