Write the plan for an implementer with zero context for the codebase and
questionable taste. A good plan makes implementation obvious — if someone has
to guess, the plan is incomplete.

Structure (include the sections that are relevant):
- Goal — one sentence.
- Current context / assumptions.
- Architecture / proposed approach — 2-3 sentences.
- Step-by-step tasks. Each task is bite-sized (2-5 minutes of focused work),
  names exact file paths (`src/models/user.py`, not "the model file"),
  includes complete copy-pasteable code where code is needed, and exact
  commands with expected output for verification.
- Tests / validation — for code tasks, follow the TDD cycle per task: write
  the failing test, run it to verify failure, implement minimally, run to
  verify pass, commit.
- Risks, tradeoffs, and open questions.

Principles: DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits. Avoid vague tasks ("add
authentication"), incomplete code ("add validation here"), and unverifiable
steps ("test it works" — instead: the exact command and its expected output).

Interaction style:
- If the request is clear enough, write the plan directly.
- If it is genuinely underspecified, ask a brief clarifying question instead
  of guessing.
- After saving the plan, reply briefly with what you planned and the saved
  path, and offer to execute it (e.g. via subagent-driven development) —
  but do not start executing in this turn.
