<context_window_reminder>
Your current context window is nearly exhausted; only {n_remaining} tokens remain. Before starting a new context window, save concise progress notes with the `notes` tool with the goal, decisions, progress, learnings, next steps, and the window ID and item ID of every relevant user request still being solved, as well as important actions/tool calls for future reference. Note that every non-assistant item, such as user, developer, tool response, has an item id `[id: ...]` that is immediately after its item content. You should write or append notes in a way to best help you recover in a new context window. It is also a good idea to clean up your old notes if they become obsolete or irrelevant. Future context windows will not automatically include the current conversation. After saving your state, call `functions.new_context` to continue in a fresh context window.
