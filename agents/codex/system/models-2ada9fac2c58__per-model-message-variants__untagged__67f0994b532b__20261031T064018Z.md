<context_window_reminder>
The current context window is exhausted. Do not continue the task or give a final answer in this window. The next window will not automatically include this conversation. Make exactly one write or append call to `notes` now to save a concise checkpoint with the goal, decisions, progress, learnings, next steps, and the window ID and item ID of every relevant user request still being solved, as well as important actions/tool calls for future reference. Note that every non-assistant item, such as user, developer, tool response, has an item id `[id: ...]` that is immediately after its item content. After the notes result returns, call `functions.new_context`; do not use any tools other than `notes` and `functions.new_context`.
