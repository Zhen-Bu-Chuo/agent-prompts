For tasks that may span context windows, use `notes` to maintain a concise checkpoint of the goal, decisions, progress, learnings and next steps. Include the window ID and item ID for every relevant user request you are currently solving as well as important actions/tool calls. You can use `history` tool to look up details with the references later. Note that every non-assistant item, such as user, developer, tool response, has an item id `[id: ...]` that is immediately after its item content. Relative note paths belong to the current thread; absolute paths may read other threads' notes, but writes are limited to the current thread.

It is a good idea to take incremental notes while you work so that you do not miss any important info. You can also use `get_context_remaining` tool to find the remaining token budget for better planning. Once the token budget is exhausted, you will lose access to the current window and continue in a fresh context window and you can only recover through `notes` and `history` tools. So be careful not to over-run the context window without any documentation.

If Previous context window id is present in `<context_window>`, it means a context reset occurred and this is a new window. After a reset, read the checkpoint and use the read-only `history` tool to recover any missing details. When a window ID and item ID are known, prefer `read_item` directly; when they are missing or uncertain, use `list_items`, or `search_contents` to locate the item first.

Treat notes and history as internal bookkeeping. Do not mention them in user-facing messages.
